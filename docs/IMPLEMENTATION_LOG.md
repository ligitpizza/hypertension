### YYYY-MM-DD — Increment N — Module X: <name>
- FRs implemented: FR-x.x, …
- Use-case exception flows handled: UCx.x E1, …
- Tests: N unit, N widget, N rules, N integration (all passing)
- Deviations / additions vs Chapter 4: (new fields/collections, changed flows — with reason)
- Known limitations:

### 2026-10-12 — Increment 0 — Project setup (walking skeleton)
- Scope: monorepo skeleton (app/, backend/, firebase/, tasks.py, .vscode/), Flutter app with
  `patient`/`family` flavors + `main_staff.dart` web entrypoint, Firebase apps registered via
  flutterfire, emulator wiring, FastAPI skeleton (auth dependency, audit logger, health,
  `/internal/jobs/heartbeat`), shared enums + `docs/fixtures/enums.json`, Firestore/Storage
  rules baseline + composite indexes, emulator seed (symptom_catalog + 1 demo account per role),
  deploy artefacts (Dockerfile, tasks.py deploy-*), commit-msg hook active.
- FRs touched (foundations only): FR-1.3 (role claim check + `require_roles`), FR-1.5 (audit
  logger), NFR-2.2 (deny-by-default rules), NFR-2.4 (debug-only cleartext), NFR-4.2 (offline
  persistence), NFR-3.1 (48 dp targets in theme).
- Tests: 23 Dart (20 unit enum-parity, 3 widget: loading/data/error), 42 pytest, 28 rules
  (Firestore + Storage, every role) — all passing. `flutter analyze`, ruff, ruff format, mypy
  --strict clean.
- Local verification: emulators + seed run; emulator sign-in as demo doctor -> FastAPI
  `/api/v1/health/auth` returns role `doctor`; heartbeat job writes `audit_logs` in the emulator.
  Staff portal web release build compiles.
- Deployed: Firestore rules + indexes and Storage rules (2026-10-12).
  Cloud Run / Hosting / Scheduler: pending (see below).
- Deviations / additions vs Chapter 4:
  - D-23 Android application IDs `fyp.hypertension.patient` / `.family`; Dart package `hypertension`.
  - D-24 `tasks.py` replaces `make` and `.sh` scripts (make not available on Windows).
  - D-12 minSdk raised 23 -> 24 (Flutter 3.44 minimum).
  - Risk level enum stored lowercase (`low|moderate|high|critical`) for consistency with the other
    snake/lower-case enums; Ch4 only names the levels.
  - `symptom_catalog` document IDs are stable slugs (e.g. `chest_pain`) instead of auto IDs, so
    seeding is idempotent and fixtures can reference them.
  - Scheduler OIDC audience is a fixed string (`careflow-internal-jobs`) verified by FastAPI;
    `/internal/jobs/*` is not under `/api`, so Hosting never exposes it.
  - Firebase emulators require JDK 21 (installed Temurin 21).
- Known limitations: Android exit test (patient app -> 10.0.2.2) not yet run — no Android
  emulator (AVD) configured on the dev machine; Android SDK licenses not yet accepted.
